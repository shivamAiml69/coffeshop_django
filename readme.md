Coffee Shop Website

This project is a web application for a coffee shop, built with Django. It features three main pages:

Home Page: The landing page that welcomes users and provides an overview of the coffee shop.
Menu Page: Displays the coffee menu, allowing users to select items and specify quantities for their order.
Bill Page: Shows the detailed bill for the selected coffee items, including quantities and total price.
The website offers a simple and interactive way for customers to browse the menu, place orders, and view their bill.
